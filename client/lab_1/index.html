    <h2>First, the basics.</h2>

      <li>Javascript</li>
      <li>Node.js</li>
      <li>And other web development frameworks</li>
    </ul>

    You should list your top 3 goals for the class below.

    <ol>
      <li>Learn front-end web design</li>
      <li>Learn new programming languages</li>
      <li>Learn how to work with others in a technical space</li>
      <li>Learn popular web dev frameworks</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>

    Sometimes you want to draw attention to something in a line of text.

    Sometimes you want to strongly emphasize something in the text.

    Sometimes you want to do both.

    <h3>Empty Elements</h3>

    Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.</br>Neither can image tags, or hard lines.</br>
    Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.

    <h2>Images</h2>

    Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.<br>

    <img alt="Onigiri image 1" src="images/onigiri_1.png" />
    <img alt="Onigiri image 2" src="images/onigiri_2.png" />
    <img alt="Onigiri image 3" src="images/onigiri_3.png" />
    <img alt="Onigiri image 4" src="images/onigiri_4.png" />
